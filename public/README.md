Place your resume file here as `resume.pdf` so the site can serve/download it.

Steps:
1. Add your PDF file and name it `resume.pdf`.
2. Rebuild/restart the dev server if it's running: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
3. The "Resume" button on the homepage will download the file as `Maduka-Jesse-Resume.pdf`.

Note: If you prefer a different filename or path, update the `href` in `src/components/Hero.tsx` accordingly.
